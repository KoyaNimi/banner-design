## Banner Design

This repository hosts multiple banner designs.  

Although I am not a designer, I created banners to understand design and designers.  

After that, I have experience in undertaking several banner production projects on crowdsourcing services.  

These are all created for learning purposes, and in consideration of copyrights and confidentiality, client work deliverables are not included.
